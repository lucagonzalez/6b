Shell Script Exercises
======================
A series of Shell Script Exercises, part 2
----------------------------------------
#### 1
Write a Shell script that creates a directory structure for the names found in the file names.txt, and taking into account an X number of personal subdirectories that must be created. The value of the X will be entered by the user as a parameter to the script call. For example, if we want to create 3 subdirectories we would make the following call: ./nameOfTheScript.sh 3
#### 2
In the rainfalls.txt file there is a series of lines that indicate the day and the amount of liters that has rained. In this exercise you will have to create a script that shows on the screen the average rainfall.
#### 3
Write a script that shows on screen the list of days that it did not rain, assuming that the first value is is Monday.
#### 4
Write a script that shows a list of the even numbers in the file numbers.txt as well as a list of the odd numbers. In addition, you must show the total of each type.
#### 5
Write a script that processes the file listed.txt. Each line of this file has a user, an operating system and a numerical value indicating the number of processes that user is running on this system. What the script is intended to do is, go through the lines of the file and calculate how many users have Linux, how many Windows and the total processes of each system.
#### 6
Write a script that simulates a command to delete .txt files. For it, the script has to receive a directory by parameter and has to delete all the files with the extension .txt that has that directory, showing at the end, a message with the amount of files that have been deleted.
#### 7
Starting from the previous exercise, before deleting, you should check if the directory exists before deleting, showing the message "The directory does not exist" in case the directory does not exist.
#### 8
Write a script that creates a list of all the IP addresses that are connected in our local network.
